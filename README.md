# 🔊 AI-Based Human Scream Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI-Based Human Scream Detection System** is designed to automatically detect human screams from audio input using machine learning techniques.  
The system aims to improve **public safety and emergency response** by identifying distress sounds such as screams in real time.

This project can be applied in **smart surveillance systems, women safety applications, elderly care, and smart cities**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To detect **human screams** accurately from audio signals
- To differentiate screams from **normal environmental sounds**
- To provide a **real-time alert mechanism**
- To reduce false alarms using AI-based classification

---

## 🧠 Motivation
Human screams often indicate **danger, panic, or emergency situations**.  
Manual monitoring is inefficient and error-prone.  
By using **Artificial Intelligence and signal processing**, this system enables automated and reliable scream detection.
